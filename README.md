Key objectives:

Sentiment Analysis: The system will classify review text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories, providing insights into patient experiences with each drug.
Satisfaction by Condition: It will analyze satisfaction levels by grouping reviews based on medical condition and generating average sentiment or rating scores.
Theme Identification (Stretch goal): For specific conditions, the system will identify and rank commonly mentioned themes in reviews, such as side effects or cost concerns.
